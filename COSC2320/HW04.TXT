                              Specifications



HW04 is to create a 2-dimensional array of bytes, initialize it properly,
and then add all the elements of either a particular row or a particular
column (which, and  which one, will be announced at a later date).

Initialization:   Element [0,0] will be set to zero. The step to add to
each element, in row major order, to get the value for the next element
will be announced later. Initialization at run time will cost 10 points;
it will therefore be better to initialize the array at assembly time.
(Note that overflow/carry is ignored in the initialization)

The number of rows and the number of columns will announced later.

The addition of the bytes will be into a 16 bit sum (i.e. propagate the
carrys). The answer will be a 16 bit answer. Write the answer, in Hex,
on the code print out sheet that is turned into your TA.

The announcement to be made later will be posted to the list server
at 4 PM next Sunday.




Example EQUs that you'll be needing
nRow                   EQU              10
nCol                   EQU              13
STEP                   EQU              42
ByRow                  EQU              1
ByCol                  EQU              1 - ByRow
